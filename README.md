A mashup of [Map Projection Distortions](http://bl.ocks.org/3709000) and [transitions](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3711652) using the [D3.js extended geographic projections plugin](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo-projection/).

A comparison of map projections by four different types of distortion:

* **Acc. 40° 150**% – The Acceptance index is a numerical measure that summarizes overall projection distortion, in this case with a maximum angular distortion of 40° and areal distortion of up to 150%.
* **Scale** – The weighted mean error for overall scale distortion.
* **Areal** – The weighted mean error for areal distortion.
* **Angular** – The mean angular deformation index.

Lower is better. Data transcribed from the [Natural Earth Projection](http://www.shadedrelief.com/NE_proj/distortion.html) by [@mbostock](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/).
